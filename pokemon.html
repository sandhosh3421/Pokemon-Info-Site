      <p><span>History of Pokemons</span><br>Pokémon are creatures, also known as "pocket monsters", that inhabit a world alongside humans. They come in a vast array of species, each with unique designs, abilities, and elemental types. Humans, called Pokémon Trainers, befriend and train these creatures to compete in battles and form strong bonds. The Pokémon world, the setting for the franchise, is a place where humans and Pokémon coexist, with Pokémon living in diverse environments like forests, caves, and oceans. 
The franchise originated as a pair of video games, Pocket Monsters Red and Green, developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo in 1996. The concept, created by Satoshi Tajiri, drew inspiration from his childhood hobby of collecting insects. The franchise quickly expanded into a global phenomenon, encompassing animated series, movies, a trading card game, and various other merchandise. 
Pokémon trainers form teams with their Pokémon and embark on adventures, participating in friendly battles and striving to become the best Pokémon trainer. Each Pokémon has unique strengths and weaknesses based on its type, adding strategic depth to battles. The franchise is known for its diverse cast of characters, including iconic Pokémon like Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and Jigglypuff, and its core message of friendship and teamwork. </p>
